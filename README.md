# Personal-Blog-Ashleigh
## Description


I was motivated to create this website as part of my bootcamp week4 challenge. This wesite was built to allow a user to make and display blog posts. I was able to make a responsive website that allows the user to input and view username, title, and content data.

This website can be used by managers and supervisors to input and view their employee name and salary on table.

 Once the user has entered in all requested data into the form, the data is stored in local storage and then the user is redirected to the blog posts page. Once on the blog posts page they will have an up to date view of all blog posted that have been submitted. If the user desires to enter a new post they can select the back button and they will be taken to the previous page to submit a new blog form.

There is a light/dark mode feature on the blog.
