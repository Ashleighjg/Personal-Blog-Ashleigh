## Description


I was motivated to modify existing code for this Employee Payroll Tracker website as part of my bootcamp week3 challenge. This project was built to showcase my proficency at basic javaScript skills. I was able to make a responsive website that allows the user to input employee information into a table.

Once the user has entered in all of the employees and their data, the average salary and total number of employees is displayed in the console. A random employee is selected out of all the employeed entered into the table.
